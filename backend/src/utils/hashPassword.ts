/**
 * Asynchronously hashes a given password using bcrypt.
 *
 * @param {string} password - The plain text password to be hashed.
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves to the hashed password.
 *
 * @example
 * const hashedPassword = await hashPassword('mySecurePassword');
 * console.log(hashedPassword); // Logs the hashed password string
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The function uses a fixed salt round value of 10 for hashing.
 * - bcrypt is a widely used library for securely hashing passwords.
 * - Always store hashed passwords instead of plain text passwords for security.
